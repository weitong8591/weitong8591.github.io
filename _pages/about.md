I am a PhD candidate working at CTU in Prague, supervised by <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=U9-D8DYAAAAJ&hl=en">Dr. Dániel Baráth</a> and <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=EJCNY6QAAAAJ&hl=en">Prof. Jiří Matas</a>. 
Before that, I completed my Master’s in Computer Science (AI specialization) at ELTE in Budapest, supervised by Dániel Baráth and Levente Hajder. \\
My research mainly focuses on subproblems of SfM, including differentiating RANSAC for pose estimation and rigid transformation, as well as improving image retrieval targeted at a good and robust initial pose graph and reconstruction. 
I am open to internship this year and postdoc/researcher positions starting next year.
