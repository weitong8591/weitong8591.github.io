I am a PhD candidate working at Czech Technical University in Prague.
I completed my Master’s in Computer Science (AI specialization) at ELTE in Budapest, supervised by Daniel Barath and Levente Hajder. I started my PhD at CTU in Prague in July 2022, working with Daniel Barath and Prof. Ji{\v{r}}{\'\i}. \\

My research mainly focuses on subproblems of SfM, including differentiating RANSAC for pose estimation and rigid transformation, as well as improving image retrieval targeted at a good and robust initial pose graph and reconstruction. 
I am open to internship this year and postdoc/researcher positions starting next year.
